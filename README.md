# The Golden Square Mocking Tasks

In this module the objectives were:

* Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
* Learn to break programs up into classes.
* Learn to debug your programs.
* Learn to build software as a pair.
* Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and
  pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

### Phase Three: Mocking

I worked through a series of exercises designed to help me learn how to isolate
tests using RSpec.

1. Unit Testing Parent-Child Classes
2. Crafting Doubles
3. Unit Testing Peer Classes
4. Unit Testing API Requests
5. Unit Testing Terminal IO

### Phase Four: Solo Project

Do this project solo. It is designed to help you test all of your skills.

### Phase Five: Battleships Challenge Project

Optionally, do this extra tricky challenge project designed for engineers who
reach the end of the sequence and want to really test their skills. I have put
this in a separate repository.
